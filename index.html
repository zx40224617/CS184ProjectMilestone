      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      The VR Deformation project aims to develop a real-time, interactive mesh
      deformation system for virtual reality environments. By enhancing
      immersion through dynamic, responsive mesh modifications, we seek to
      explore novel ways users can interact with and manipulate virtual objects
      directly via hand tracking or controller inputs.

      <h2>Approach</h2>
      Custom Shader-Based Deformation: Leverages GPU-powered shaders to compute
      and render mesh deformations at high performance without modifying the
      underlying mesh data on the CPU. Vertex Modification Deformation: Involves
      direct manipulation of vertex positions on the CPU or GPU compute shaders,
      allowing for fine-grained control over deformation behavior but requiring
      efficient data transfer strategies.

      <h2>Progress To Date</h2>
      We have successfully completed the initial setup of our development
      environment:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Installed and configured Unity with the necessary XR plugins
          (OpenXR/OVR).
        </li>
        <li>
          Established a stable connection to our target VR device (e.g., Meta
          Quest), including reliable hand-tracking data retrieval.
        </li>
        <li>
          Started prototyping the deformation logic within custom Unity shaders,
          referencing existing open-source implementations.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Preliminary Results</h2>
      Our preliminary experiments indicate:
      <ul>
        <li>
          The shader-based approach can achieve visually convincing deformations
          in real time. Prior art demonstrates feasibility, and we plan to
          enhance realism through improved normal mapping and shading
          techniques.
        </li>
        <li>
          To date, no known Unity solutions implement our vertex modification
          scheme without third-party plugins, highlighting the novelty of our
          second approach.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Updated Work Plan</h2>
      Following insightful discussions with our TA and Prof. Ren Ng, we have
      decided to:
      <ol>
        <li>
          Focus efforts on refining and optimizing the shader-based deformation
          first, aiming to deliver a fully functional demo within the next
          milestone.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once the shader implementation is validated, reassess and prototype
          the vertex modification technique to compare performance and visual
          fidelity.
        </li>
      </ol>

      This strategy ensures rapid verification of at least one robust solution
      before investing resources into the complementary approach.

      <h2>Next Steps</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Complete advanced shader features (e.g., adaptive tessellation,
          improved lighting).
        </li>
        <li>
          Conduct performance benchmarks across different mesh complexities.
        </li>
        <li>
          Integrate intuitive user interactions via hand tracking for real-time
          deformation control.
        </li>
      </ul>
